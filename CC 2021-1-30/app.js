//Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.
//Examples:
//1: -1
//14: -14
//-34: 34

function opposite(n){
    return n * -1
  }
  
  //below is my old answer (attempt). I figured this out in a MINUTE on the 30 of March. It's probably been a few weeks to a month since I first tried this. So proud of how fast I knew how to solve it!
  // function opposite(n1) {
  //   let answer = []
  //   for (a of answer){
  //     a * -1
  //   }
  // }
  // opposite(14,1,12)
