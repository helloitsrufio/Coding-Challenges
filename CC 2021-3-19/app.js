// Make sure you understand these before taking a look at the question:
// Objects (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)

// 👆🏾  Make sure you remember/review bracket notation for objects!  You can check if a property exists and increment a value tied to that property HINT HINT!

    // Count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

    // What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

// Hint: loop through the characters and use bracket notation to add one to the value for that letter in the object or add that letter as a property of the object with the value of 1
