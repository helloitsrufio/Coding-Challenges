// // Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

// // Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

// // You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

// // If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

// // All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

// // Test.assertEquals(high('man i need a taxi up to ubud'), 'taxi');
// // Test.assertEquals(high('what time are we climbing up the volcano'), 'volcano'); 
// // Test.assertEquals(high('take me to semynak'), 'semynak');

//Hint: Remember our past problem that used an alphabet string. Think about reduce, indexOf, and creating a function to check the score then looping through your words!
