//Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.

function makeUpperCase(str) {
    return str.toUpperCase()
  }

//Thoughts:
//I have been doing 8kyu for months now and haven't felt confident in it. Maybe this was just a really easy 8kyu, but I did this in less than a minute. I think it may be time for me to try some 7kyu, even if they are very difficult for me.

//Additionally, it's exciting to see that I knew exactly what to do for this function. I know stuff! I know JS (to an extent)! I am capable and have worked to get where I am. My confidence is finally starting to catch up with me. I don't feel like I see a lot of change in my knowledge/status as a student, but I do feel like I saw it today. I'm excited to see in what other ways I progress in the future. :)
